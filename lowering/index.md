## Lowering your 2cv

Lowering a 2cv is dead easy - just slacken the suspension tie-rods until:

1. It comes out altogether and the car falls the floor
1. The car sits on its bump stops
1. You get the height you prefer

NOTE: The car should be jacked up before adjusting the tie-rods.

You may find that the car sits unevenly - in which case you need to level it up (link).

Caster angle - as you lower the car the sterring angle will get slacker, making the stering heavy (and other things too). If you want to restore the designed angle (15deg ?loaded?) then the front-arms will need to be cut and turned. This is a very precise job so beware if 'having a go'.
