First of all, let's get clear what we are talking about here, with a little theory. 

Power = Torque x revs. 

There, I said it. A lot of people have a hard time getting their heads around the "torque" concept. This may explain it a little. Torque values depend on how much fuel you can convert into mechanical energy per revolution. Power is the result of that torque, multiplied with the rpm. So, to increase max horsepower, you can either increase max-rpm or increase torque. 

Now, what does it do, I hear you ask? Max horspower is only available at max rpm, so that (along with wind- and other resistance factors and gear ratios) determines your top speed. Torque determines your rate of acceleration, your "pulling power". It is useful at any rpm, for instance driving along at 80kms and wanting to overtake. When you press down on the pedal, it depends on your torque value at that rpm how the car responds. If you have low torque at that rpm, you may have to shift down from 4th to 3rd gear. 

Back to practicality: I have had both AM2A (8,5:1) and AM2 (9.0:1) engines in the same car, with same carburettor (and jets), original airfilter and I can detect no difference in performance. Theoretically, increased compression means faster burning of fuel in cylinder, so better efficiency and more torque. There may be an increase in power and torque but I have not found it. 

The biggest difference I have noticed is to first make sure that the engine is in good condition. 

- Valve clearance must be set properly, 
- you can test compression to see if the piston rings are still OK,
- set the ignition right, make sure you have the right spark plugs and that they are in good condition (as well as the leads and connections), 
- clean airfilter, 
- good oil filler tube and 
- a clean oilcooler and 
- decent oil to keep the engine as cool as possible. 
- Clean the carb, 
- fit a new fuel filter, 
- check fuel pump membrane and 
- check for air leaks around the carb. 

You may be surprised to see how much difference it makes (as noted before by my dutch colleague). Trying to tune an engine that is not already in perfect condition is useless. 

What I have found in daily use is that an electronic ignition is the first thing to get, as it helps in starting (stronger spark), as well as providing better pick-up because of better ignition advance curve. Moreover, it saves you the trouble of adjusting and changing points, which is often, if you drive it daily. 

If you are going to use the car for daily cruising, doing big distances occasionally and taking a lot of extra weight once in a while (friends or parts etc), you want to make the car more driveable. This means more torque over the entire rpm-band and the ability to do high rpms for a long time (for highway cruising). 

If you want more torque, it is vital that you get more air into the engine first, then re-jet the carb to get the mixture back up to the right numbers. The size of the jet determines how much fuel gets mixed into the inlet air. The bigger the jet, the more fuel you can add, limited only by fuel pump capacity (in extreme cases). 

In the 80's carbs were set up not to get max performance out of the engine but to meet emission standards, depending on the country of sale. It may be set too rich, to minimize NOx emissions or maybe set too lean, to minimize CO emissions (not to be confused with CO2, where the light 2Cv performs very well). Re-jetting your carb on a rolling road, or using a lambda sensor can give you up to 3hp more, cheap & easy! 

However, the 2CV engine is set up as standard to make the most torque at the widest rpm-range, to make it as driveable and flexible as possible. Changing air filters and exhaust is a way of increasing torque (and power) at some point in the rpm-range but it doesn't necessarily mean it wil be nicer to drive! Any tuning of inlet and exhaust (and re-jetting carbs after!) usually means shifting the peak torque to higher rpms. This means engine will be more racy but will have to be revved to get performance. In extreme cases, your girlfriend may stall it while driving away. 

Also, if you load your car up for the holidays and drive in heavy traffic, having low torque at low rpms is a real pain because you will have to let the clutch slip a lot and downshift every time you encounter a hill. 

The easiest and cheapest way to increase torque all over the rpm-range is a "power tube". Cheap and easy to install, it will gain you 2-3 hp (with re-jetting of carb) without any other modifications. It doesn't increase inlet air pressure as some people think but it provides the engine with cool air, which holds more oxygen. More oxygen means more fuel can be burned, over entire rpm-range. 

Also a good way of improving torque over entire range is to increase engine volume. Visa pistons and cylinders do that very well, fitted to a 602 crankcase. Why not fit a Visa engine instead? Must be easier. Yes it is but the Visa engine has a heavier crankshaft and can run less rpms. Therefore, you gain torque but lose max rpm and the power output is about the same. 

Matt black mentioned reducing flywheel weight. This does nothing for your torque or power output but it does change the behaviour of your engine. The flywheel is there to make the engine run more smoothly. It is a big weight which spins fast and it makes it more difficult to increase or decease engine speed. Therefore, it absorbs the blows from the two pistons per four crank revolutions and makes the whole thing run smooth. 

Resisting changes in engine speed makes it hard to rev quickly. You will notice with a 2CV that it takes a while for the engine to come up to speed when you press the loud pedal. Decrease the weight of the flywheel and it will start to respond better and feel more racy. There is a downside. When you approach a hill, a heavy flywheel will resist changing engine speed so your car speed will be maintained. Lightening the flywheel means you will lose speed faster and it will APPEAR you have less torque. 

Finally, I want to say something about the nicest (and most costly) way of improving max power through higher rpms: engine balancing. Normally, cast connecting rods, crankshafts and pistons are a little inaccurate when produced. They may vary in weight, just a few grams but this will cause vibration in the engine. Vibration takes energy away from the process of burning fuel, so essentially, it means a loss of power. If you take the engine apart, you can weigh the pistons and connecting rods to match them by taking weight off the heaviest one. A crankshaft can be balanced, too but only dynamically (like a wheel is balanced). This is done in the factory, but not to a very high degree. It means a lot of work but can result in a very smooth engine. You may have to change to stiffer valve springs if you get to very high rpms. 

As for reliability and ease of repairs, I have to say that if you suddenly knock a hole in your sump, you are doing something very wrong with a 2CV engine. If you maintain a 2CV engine the way it was described by Citroen and not tune it to run 45hp @ 8.000rpm, little can go wrong. 

I have driven thousands of highway kilometres at full speed, on 95 octane unleaded, often in 30 degree heat, many times with two people and holiday luggage and always lugging around a heavy Acadiane chassis and wooden body. I always drive pedal to the metal (traffic allowing) and I do not have excessive valve wear, loss of compression, it doesn't use oil and it starts and runs smoothly. 

This is my experience of daily driving more or less tuned engines in the last years and driving tuned 2CV's, Burtons and Lomaxes while working for Burton Car co. 

And they all lived happily ever after. The End
